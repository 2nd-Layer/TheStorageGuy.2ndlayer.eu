      In general, we don't accept payments for reviews of software, or hardware products be it 
      enterprise or small-office / home-office products. With that said, our access to such software
      and hardware is limited and thus <strong>we do partner</strong> with manufacturers, distributors
      or resellers of such products.
    </p>
    <p>
      That means, if you are a <strong>manufacturer</strong>, <strong>distributor</strong> or
      <strong>reseller</strong> of a product that you think may fit within the scope of this website or
      our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp-grc_OkwssH4XcSU7Loyw">YouTube channel</a> 
      we encourage you to get in touch with us via e-mail 
      <a href="mailto:TheStorageGuy@protonmail.ch">TheStorageGuy@protonmail.ch</a> to see if an
      agreement can be reached.

      For review of <strong>interesting</strong> software product, that can be easily deployed in an
      virtual envrionment we <strong>do not accept, nor require compensation</strong>.
      If the workload can't be virtualized or needs some non-standard hardware, we may require you to 
      provide such non-standard hardware, or to provide compensation <strong>for time spent rebuilding 
      our lab</strong> so we can depoy and test your products.
    </p>
    <p>
      For review of <strong>interesting</strong> hardware product for enterprise or SOHO segment, we will
      at our discresion decide if we would be satisfied with a remote access to your demo environment, 
      or if we would rather review it in out own environment. In case that on-site review will be deemed 
      optimal, we will require you to cover the costs of shipping both to our custody and back to you if 
      you request us to send back the equipment in question.
