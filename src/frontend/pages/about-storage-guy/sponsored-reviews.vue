      In general, I don't accept payments for reviews of software, or hardware products from either 
      the enterprise or small-office / home-office products. With that said, my access to such software
      and hardware is limited and thus <strong>I do partner</strong> with manufacturers, distributors
      or resellers of such products.
      </p>
    <p>
      That means, if you are a <strong>manufacturer</strong>, <strong>distributor</strong> or
      <strong>reseller</strong> of a product that you think may fit within the scope of this website or
      my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp-grc_OkwssH4XcSU7Loyw">YouTube channel</a> 
      I encourage you to get in touch with me via e-mail 
      <a href="mailto:TheStorageGuy@protonmail.ch">TheStorageGuy@protonmail.ch</a> to see if an
      agreement can be reached.

      For review of <strong>interesting</strong> software product, that can be easily deployed in an
      virtual envrionment we <strong>do not accept, nor require compensation</strong>, if the workload can't
      be virtualized or needs some non-standard hardware, we may require you to provide such non-standard
      hardware, or to provide compensation <strong>for time spent rebuilding our lab</strong> so we can
      depoy and test your products.
    </p>
    <p>
      For review of <strong>interesting</strong> hardware product for enterprise or SOHO segment, we will
      at our discresion decide if we would be satisfied with a remote review of your product, or would
      rather review it in out own environment. In case that on-site review will be deemed optimal, we will
      require you to cover the costs of shipping both to our custody and back to you if you request us to
      send back the equipment in question.
