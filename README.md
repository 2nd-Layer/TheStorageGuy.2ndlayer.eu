The Storage Guy website, website representing a profile of Mark Stopka and his network of advisors as a pitch to why [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) and [Tezos](https://tezos.foundation/) stake-holders should delegate their stake and/or governance voting power to [LAYER stake-pools](https://staking.2ndlayer.eu) and **The Storage Guy** specifically (in case of [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) which has different governance model).

## Intro
I was born 978 days after **The Hacker Manifesto** was published, on 12th of September 1988, in what was at the time Czechoslovakia, part of Eastern block, but not part of the Soviet Union. Since my early childhood, I was fascinated by technology, and computers in particulart, although I did not myself have one (32-bit) till about the age of 13. I was often given the opportunity to work with computers owned by others, and sometime even fix their issues even though I did not have one to call my own.

I remember like it was yesterday, when I discovered a book about neural networks when I was still is 3rd or 4th grade of primary school and was reading about these strange, hard to grasp concepts when visiting my aunt that was living about 40 minutes drive in the country side from our apartment in the city of Ostrava, 3rd largest city in Czech Republic. We often visited my aunt in the countryside for the entire weekends, so while my dad was helping around the farm, I was reading this book and thinking about artificial inteligence - in a way that one is limited to at the age 10 or 11.

My first computer was some ADM clocked at 650 Mhz with I think 256 MiB of memory and 80 GB of HDD space, I think I was going to 4th grade by that time. It came pre-installed with Windows 98 which was soon updated to Windows Milenium Edition, I attemped shortly after that to replace it by Mandriva Linux at the time, however, as I discovered few years later I was very unlucky... The computer was a gift for completing the Future Kids sort of a paid-for class where they tried to teach us basic use of a computer like Word processor and Excel spreadshets, or MS Paint for that matter. Class was led by a fellow who much, much later became my friend after he attended one of my Linux meetups about 6 years later.

The LG CD-RW mechanics which my computer was equiped with contained a microcode bug, that was triggered by Linux kernel at the time, efectively rendering it malfunctional. I did not give up... I accidentaly met a guy in a bus, don't remember from where I was going anymore, and I saw him, with a Linux logo on his t-shirt, he was a grown adult, but I did spark a conversation with him, which led to him offering me a helping hand and he introduced me to people working at his company called [LinuxBox](https://www.linuxbox.cz/en/). More specifically he introduced me to a Hacker, Hacker in the original sense of the word, he gave me a gift, he introduced me to Gentoo Linux by giving me a **Gentoo Stage 1 Live CD** and **The Gentoo Installation Handbook**.

You see, [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) was back then, and probably still is the most configurable Linux distribution available with most hands-on work, and least automation after [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/). Internet, although I had it at home, was a luxurious good, I had a 56 kb/s dial-up modem and was allowed to spend about 1 or 2 hours a day being connected due to pay-per-minute pricing model. After about 3 days of tinkering around, compiling, re-compiling,... I had a working Gentoo Linux on my computer in dual-boot configuration with Windows. But that wasn't the greatest achievement of this excersises, the greatest achievement was the knowledge about the system that I have gathered during the installation process.

I started to understand the different levels of abstractions that are present in moders computers, where system **Kernel** abstracts hardware not only from it's users, but also from the applications running in so-called user-space. I became familiar with the concept of scheduler, I knew there were different types of schedulers, like preemptive or cooperative. Yet, I do have to admit, that I did use utility called `genkernel` to build my first Linux kernel and have not selected the individual drivers to be put into my first compiled **Linux kernel**.
