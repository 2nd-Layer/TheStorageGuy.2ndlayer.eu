The Storage Guy website, website representing a profile of Mark Stopka and his network of advisors as a pitch to why [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) and [Tezos](https://tezos.foundation/) stake-holders should delegate their stake and/or governance voting power to [LAYER stake-pools](https://staking.2ndlayer.eu) and **The Storage Guy** specifically (in case of [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) which has different governance model).

## Intro
I was born 978 days after **The Hacker Manifesto** was published, on 12th of September 1988, in what was the Czechoslovakia, part of Eastern block, but not part of the Soviet Union. Since my early childhood, I was fascinated by technology, and computers in particulart, although I did not myself have one till about the age of 13. I was often given the opportunity to work with computers owned by others, and sometime even fix their issues although not havign one.

I remember like it was yesterday, when I discovered a book about neural networks when I was still is 3rd or 4th grade of primary school and was reading about these strange, hard to grasp concepts when visiting my aunt that was living about 40 minutes drive in the country side from our apartment in the city of Ostrava, 3rd largest city in Czech Republic.

My first computer was some ADM clocked at 650 Mhz with I think 256 MiB of memory and 80 GB of HDD space, I think I was going to 5th grade by that time. It came pre-installed with Windows 98 which was soon updated to Windows Milenium Edition, I attemped shortly after that to replace it by Mandriva Linux at the time, however, as I discovered few years later I was very unlucky...

The LG CD-RW mechanics which my computer was equiped with contained a microcode bug, that was triggered by Linux kernel at the time, efectively rendering it malfunctional. I did not give up... I accidentaly met a guy in a bus, don't remember from where I was going anymore, and I saw him, with a Linux logo on his t-shirt, he was a grown adult, but I did spark a conversation with him, which led to him offering me a helping hand by obtaining a Gentoo Stage 1 LiveCD and the copy of **Gentoo Installation Handbook**.
